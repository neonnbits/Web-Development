// Step 1: Start Execution

// ðŸ”¹ fs.readFile sends file reading to a worker thread and moves on.
// ðŸ”¹ The for-loop starts running (synchronously, on the main thread).

// Step 2: Worker Thread Completes fs.readFile

// ðŸ”¹ The worker thread completes the file reading in parallel.
// ðŸ”¹ But instead of executing the callback, it queues it in the callback queue.

// Step 3: The for-loop Blocks the Main Thread

// ðŸ”¹ The main thread is stuck executing the for-loop, so it cannot process the callback yet.
// ðŸ”¹ The event loop is busy with the loop, and nothing else gets executed.

// Step 4: Event Loop Finally Executes the Callback

// ðŸ”¹ Once the for-loop finishes, the event loop picks up the fs.readFile callback from the queue and executes it.
// ðŸ”¹ File contents are printed last, even though they were ready much earlier!
